## Project Overview

In this technical test, the candidate is required to design and develop a Next.js application that incorporates Firebase Authentication for user login and registration. The application's main feature is a GIF search functionality powered by the GIPHY API. Additionally, the candidate has the option to implement additional tasks, such as marking GIFs as favorites, hot searching, loading animations, and hosting the app on Vercel or GitHub Pages.

## Authentication Requirements

- Users must be able to log in using their email and password or sign up for a new account.

- Firebase Authentication web SDK should be used for implementing the authentication process. Create your own Firebase account to set up the authentication.
